Recipe Exercise – Pancakes
This project was built as part of a recipe exercise where the goal was to recreate a provided design using only HTML and CSS. The design was followed as closely as possible, with a focus on semantic structure (and I also added accessibility (WCAG)).

Features and Implementation
Semantic HTML: The page structure uses elements such as main, section, header, footer, h1–h2, ul, and ol to ensure clarity and meaning in the markup.
Accessibility: ARIA attributes like aria-labelledby and descriptive alt texts were added to improve screen reader support and meet WCAG guidelines.
Hero Image: The header image spans the full width of the layout (1280px) and maintains a fixed height of 500px using object-fit: cover (the measurments have been taken from the Figma design).
Image Gallery: The gallery displays two square images side by side, each taking up equal space with a consistent gap, using flexbox, aspect-ratio, and object-fit.
External CSS: All styling is handled through a separate CSS file located in the styles folder.
Attention to Detail: Typography, spacing, and colors have been carefully adjusted to match the design closely.

Notes
This version targets desktop and does not include responsive layout.
The project was created using Visual Studio Code.
Version control was handled with Git, and the project was continuously committed and uploaded to GitHub.
